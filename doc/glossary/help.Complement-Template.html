<h1>Complement-Template</h1>

The complement of a <a href="help.Template.html">template</a>  is found by taking each <a href="help.nop-instructions.html">no-operation</a>  instruction that makes up that template, and shifting it to the next in alphabetical order, looping around at the end. Thus, in the default instruction set, nop-A -> nop-B -> nop-C -> nop-A. The template "nop-B nop-A nop-C nop-C" has the complement "nop-C nop-B nop-A nop-A".
