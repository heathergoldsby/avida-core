<title>CPU Components : Stack</title>

<h1>Stack</h1>

Each <a href="help.CPU.html">CPU</a>  in avida has two stacks used for storage of numbers. The <a href="help.push.html">push</a>  and <a href="help.pop.html">pop</a>  instructions are used to move numbers between the <a href="help.Registers.html">registers</a>  and the stack, and the <a href="help.swap-stk.html">swap-stk</a>  instruction toggles the active stack in use.
