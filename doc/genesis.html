<h2 align=center>The Genesis File</h2>

<p>
The genesis file is the main configuration file for Avida.  With this
file, the user can setup all of the basic conditions for a run.  Below are
detailed descriptions for some of the settings in genesis, with the ones
you should be most concerned about colored in green.  The non-colored 
entries you will probably never need to change unless you are doing a very
specialized project.

<h3>Architecture Variables</h3>

<p>
This section covers all of the basic variables that describe the Avida run.
This is effectively a miscellaneous category for settings that don't fit
anywhere below.

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 border=2>
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>MAX_UPDATES<br>
               MAX_GENERATIONS<br>
               END_CONDITION_MODE</tt></b>
    <td>These settings allow the user to determine for how long the run
        should progress in generations and in updates, and determine if one
        or both criteria need to be met for the run to end.  The
        run will also end if ever the entire population has died out.  A
        setting of -1 for either ending condition will indicate no limit.
        End conditions can also be set in the events file, as is done by
        default, so you typically won't need to worry about this.
<tr><td valign=top bgcolor="#AAFFAA"><b><tt>WORLD-X<br>
               WORLD-Y</tt></b>
    <td bgcolor="#AAFFAA">The settings determine the size of the Avida grid
	that the organisms populate.  In mass action mode the shape of the
	grid is not relevant, only the number of organisms that are in it.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>MAX_CPU_THREADS</tt></b>
    <td>At the moment, I think this feature isn't working.  Ideally, it
        determines the number of simultaneous processes that an organism
        can run.  That is, basically, the number of things it can do at once.
<tr><td valign=top bgcolor="#AAFFAA"><b><tt>RANDOM_SEED</tt></b>
    <td bgcolor="#AAFFAA">The random number seed initializes the random number generator.  You
        should alter only this seed if you want to perform a collection of
        replicate runs.  Setting the random number seed to zero (or a negative
        number) will base the seed on the starting time of the run
        -- effectively a random random number seed.  In practice, you want
        to always be able to re-do an exact run in case you want to get
        more information about what happened.
</table>

<p>
<h3>Configuration Files</h3>

This section relates avida to other files that it requires.

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 border=2>
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>DEFAULT_DIR</tt></b>
    <td>This entry allows the user to enter a directory name where Avida
        can find the other needed configuration files if they are not local.
<tr><td valign=top bgcolor="#AAFFAA"><b><tt>INST_SET<br>
                          EVENT_FILE<br>
                          ANALYZE_FILE<br>
                          ENVIRONMENT_FILE<br>
                          START_CREATURE</tt></b>
    <td valign=top bgcolor="#AAFFAA">These settings indicate the names of all
	of the other configuration files used in an Avida run.  See the
	individual documents for more information about how to use these files.
</table>

<p>
<h3>Reproduction</h3>

<p>
These settings control how creatures are born and die in Avida.

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 border=2>
<tr><td valign=top bgcolor="#AAFFAA"><b><tt>BIRTH_METHOD</tt></b>
    <td bgcolor="#AAFFAA">The birth method sets how the placement of a child organism is
        determined.  Currently, there are six ways of doing this -- the
        first four (0-3) are all grid-based (offspring are only placed
        in the immediate neighborhood), and the last two (4-5) assume
        a well-stirred population.  In all non-random methods, empty
        sites are preferred over replacing a living organism.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>DEATH_METHOD<br>
                          AGE_LIMIT</tt></b>
    <td>By default, replacement is the only way for an organism to die in
        avida.  However, if a death method is set, organisms will dies of
        old age.  In method one, organisms will die when they reach the
        user-specified age limit.  In method 2, the age limit is a multiple
        of their length, so larger organisms can live longer.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>ALLOC_METHOD</tt></b>
    <td>During the replication process, parent organisms must allocate memory
        space for their child-to-be.  Before the child is copied into this
        new memory, it must have an initial value.  Setting the alloc method
        to zero sets this memory to a default instruction (typical nop-A).
        Mode 1 leaves it uninitialized (and hence keeps the contents of the
        last organism that inhabited that space; if only a partial copy
        occurs, the child is a hybrid if the parent and the dead organism,
        hence the name necrophilia).  Mode 2 just randomizes each instruction.
        This means that the organism will behave unpredictably if the
        uninitialized code is executed.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>DIVIDE_METHOD</tt></b>
    <td>When a divide occurs, does the parent divide into two children, or
        else do we have a distinct parent and child?  The latter method
        will allow more age structure in a population where an organism
        may behave differently when it produces its second or later
        offspring.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>GENERATION_INC_METHOD</tt></b>
    <td>The generation of an organism is the number of organisms in the
        chain between it and the original ancestor.  Thus, the generation
        of a population can be calculated as the average generation of the
        individual organisms.  When a divide occurs, the child always receives
        a generation one higher than the parent, but what should happen to
        the generation of the parent itself?  In general, this should be
        set the same as divide method.
</table>

<h3>Divide Restrictions</h3>

<p>
These place limits on when an organism can successfully issue a divide
command to produce an offspring.

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 border=2>
<tr><td valign=top bgcolor="#AAFFAA"><b><tt>CHILD_SIZE_RANGE</tt></b>
    <td bgcolor="#AAFFAA">This is the maximal difference in genome size between a parent and
        offspring.  The default of 2.0 means that the genome of the child
        must be between one-half and twice the length of the parent.  This
        it to prevent out-of-control size changes.  Setting this to 1.0 will
        ensure fixed length organisms (but make sure to also turn off
        insertion and deletion mutations).
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>MIN_COPIED_LINES<br>
                          MIN_EXE_LINES</tt></b>
    <td>These settings place limits on what the parent must have done before
        the child can be born; they set the minimum fraction of instructions
        that must have been copied into the child (vs. left as default) and
        the minimum fraction of instructions in the parent that must have
        been executed.  If either of these are not met, the divide will fail.
        These settings prevent organisms from producing pathological
        offspring.  In practice, either of them can be set to 0.0 to turn them
        off.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>REQUIRE_ALLOCATE</tt></b>
    <td>Is an allocate required between each successful divide?  If so,
        this will limit the flexibility of how organisms produce children
        (they can't make multiple copies and divide them off all at once,
        for example).  But if we don't require allocates, the resulting
        organisms can be a lot more difficult to understand.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>REQUIRED_TASK</tt></b>
    <td>This was originally a hack.  It allows the user to set the ID number
        for a task that <i>must</i> occur for a divide to be successful.
        At -1, no tasks are required.  Ideally, this should be incorporated
        into the environment configuration file.
</table>

<h3>Mutations</h3>

<p>
These settings control how and when mutations occur in organisms.  Ideally,
there will be more options here in the future.

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 border=2>
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>POINT_MUT_PROB</tt></b>
    <td>Point mutations (sometimes referred to as "cosmic ray" mutations)
        occur every update; the rate set here is a probability for each site
        that it will be mutated each update.  In other words, this should
        be a very low value if it is turned on at all.  If a mutation occurs,
        that site is replaced with a random instruction.  In practice this
        also slows avida down if it is non-zero because it requires so many
        random numbers to be tested every update.
<tr><td valign=top bgcolor="#AAFFAA"><b><tt>COPY_MUT_PROB</tt></b>
    <td bgcolor="#AAFFAA">The copy mutation probability is tested each time an organism copies 
        a single instruction.  If a mutation occurs, a random instruction is
        copied to the destination.  In practice this is the most common type
        of mutations that we use in most of our experiments.
<tr><td valign=top bgcolor="#AAFFAA"><b><tt>INS_MUT_PROB<br>
                          DEL_MUT_PROB</tt></b>
    <td bgcolor="#AAFFAA">These probabilities are tested once per gestation cycle (when an
        organism is first born) at each position where an instruction could
        be inserted or deleted, respectively.  Each of these mutations change
        the genome length.  Deletions just remove an instruction while
        insertions add a new, random instruction at the position tested.
        Multiple insertions and deletions are possible each generation.
<tr><td valign=top bgcolor="#AAFFAA"><b><tt>DIVIDE_MUT_PROB<br>
                          DIVIDE_INS_PROB<br>
                          DIVIDE_DEL_PROB</tt></b>
    <td bgcolor="#AAFFAA">Divide mutation probabilities are tested when an organism is
        being divided off from its parent.  If one of these mutations
        occurs, a random site is picked for it within the genome.  At most
        one divide mutation of each type is possible during a single
        divide.
</table>


<h3>Mutation Reversions</h3>

<p>
This section covers tests that are very CPU intensive, but allow for
avida experiments that would not be possible in any other system.  Basically,
each time a mutation occurs, we can run the resulting organism on a
test CPU, and determine if that mutations was lethal, detrimental, neutral,
or beneficial, as well as the type of mutation it was.  This section allows
us to act on this.  (Note that as soon as anything here is turned on, the
mutations need to be tested.  Turning multiple settings on will cost no
additional speed decrease)

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 border=2>
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>REVERT_FATAL<br>
                          REVERT_DETRIMENTAL<br>
                          REVERT_NEUTRAL<br>
                          REVERT_BENEFICIAL</tt></b>
    <td valign=top>When a mutation occurs of the specified type, the number
        listed next to that entry is the probability that the mutation will
        be reverted.  That is, the child organism's genome will be restored
        as if the mutation had never occurred.  This allows us both to 
        manually manipulate the abundance of certain mutation types, or
        to entirely eliminate them.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>STERILIZE_FATAL<br>
                          STERILIZE_DETRIMENTAL<br>
                          STERILIZE_NEUTRAL<br>
                          STERILIZE_BENEFICIAL</tt></b>
    <td valign=top>The sterilize options work similarly to revert; the
        difference being that an organism never has its genome restored.
        Instead, if the selected mutation category occurs, the child is
        sterilized so that it still takes up space, but can never produce an
        offspring of its own.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>FAIL_IMPLICIT</tt></b>
    <td>If this toggle is set, organisms <i>must</i> be able to produce
        exact copies of themselves or else they are sterilized and cannot
        produce any offspring.  An organism that naturally (without any
        external effects) produces an inexact copy of itself is said to
        have implicit mutations.  If this flag is set, explicit mutations
        (as described in the mutations section above) can still occur.
</table>

<h3>Time Slicing</h3>

These settings describe exactly what an update is, and how CPU time is
allocated to organisms during that update.

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 border=2>
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>AVE_TIME_SLICE</tt></b>
    <td>This sets the average number of instructions an organism should
        execute each update.  Organisms with a low merit will consistently
        obtain fewer, while organisms of a higher merit will receive more.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>SLICING_METHOD</tt></b>
    <td>This setting determines the method by which CPU time is handed out
        to the organisms.  Method 0 ignores merit, and hands out time on the
        CPU evenly; each organism executes one instruction for the whole
        population before moving onto the second.  Method 1 is
        probabilistic; each organism has a chance of executing the
        next instruction proportional to it merit.  This method is slow
        due to the large number of random values that need to be obtained
        and evaluated (and it only gets slower as merits get higher).
        Method 2 is fully integrated; the organisms get CPU time proportional
        to their merit, but in a fixed, deterministic order.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>SIZE_MERIT_METHOD</tt></b>
    <td>This setting determines the base value of an organism's merit.
        Merit is typically proportional to genome length otherwise there
        is a strong selective pressure for shorter genomes (shorter genome
        => less to copy => reduced copying time => replicative advantage).
        Unfortunately, organisms will cheat if merit is proportional to 
        the full genome length -- they will add on unexecuted and uncopied
        code to their genomes creating a code bloat.  This isn't the most
        elegant fix, but it works.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>TASK_MERIT_METHOD</tt></b>
    <td>This toggle determines if merit can be increased by performing
        tasks.  Ideally, this should just be taken care of in the
        environment file.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>MAX_LABEL_EXE_SIZE</tt></b>
    <td>Labels are sequences of nop (no-operation) instructions used only
        to modify the behavior of other instructions.  Quite often, an
        organism will have these labels in their genomes where the nops are
        used by another instruction, but never executed directly.  To
        represent the executed length of an organism correctly, we need to
        somehow count these labels.  Unfortunately, if we count the entire
        label, the organisms will again "cheat" artificially increasing
        their length by growing huge labels.  This setting limits the 
        number of nops that are counted as executed when a label is used.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>MERIT_TIME</tt></b>
    <td>When should merit be updated for an organisms?  A 0 here indicates
        that every time a task is completed, the merit should immediately
        be updated to reflect that task.  A 1 means that the merit is
        only updated on a divide (taking into account all the merit earned
        over the organisms lifetime) and passed on to both the parent and
        child for their next gestation cycle.  Since there are such radical
        merit changes over the lifetime of an organism, method 0 can cause
        some odd effects where once an organism builds up enough merit they
        can have lots of offspring rapidly, but most organisms dies in
        infancy.  Method 1 keeps merit constant for an organisms' entire
        life, but innovations are only rewarded one generation removed.  At
        some point we could add an option of the highest of the two.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>MAX_NUM_TASKS_REWARDED</tt></b>
    <td>This setting allows the user to limit the total number (but not
        magnitude) of rewards that and organism gets by performing tasks.
        This is another quick hack, and should probably be incorporated into
        the environment configuration file.
</table>

<h3>Genotype Info</h3>

<p>
These settings control how avida monitors and deals with genotypes,
species, and lineages.

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 border=2>
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>THRESHOLD</tt></b>
    <td>For some statistics, we only want to measure organisms that we are
        sure are alive, but its not worth taking the time to run them all
        in isolation, without outside effect (and in some eco-system situations
        that isn't even possible!).  For these purposes, we call a genotype
        "threshold" if there have ever been more than a certain number of
        organisms of that genotype.  A higher number here ensures a greater
        probability that the organisms are indeed "alive".  Recently, we've
        been shifting away from using threshold genotypes and instead finding
        other, more accurate testing methods.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>GENOTYPE_PRINT</tt></b>
    <td>Should all genotypes be printed out upon reaching threshold?  Each
        will receive its own file in the genebank directory, so this can
        get <i>very</i> hard disk intensive.  Many runs will have in the
        millions of organisms.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>GENOTYPE_PRINT_DOM</tt></b>
    <td>Printing only the dominant genotype keeps track of the most
        successful individual genotypes without costing a huge amount of
        memory.  The number you place here is the total number of updates
        that a genotype must remain dominant for it to be printed out.  A
        0 turns this off.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>SPECIES_THRESHOLD</tt></b>
    <td>In Avida, two organisms are said to be of the same species if you
        can perform all possible crossovers between them, and no more than
        a certain threshold (set here) fail to be viable offspring.  The
        crossovers are done in isolation, and never affect the population as
        a whole.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>SPECIES_RECORDING</tt></b>
    <td>This entry sets if and how species should be recorded in avida.  A
        setting of 0 turns all species tests off.  A setting of 1 means that
        every time a genotype reaches threshold, it is tested against all
        currently existing species to determine if it is part of any of them.
        If so, its species is set, and if not, it becomes the prototype of a
        new species.  Finally, a setting of 2 only tests a new threshold
        genotype against the species of its parent (since each species test
        can take a long time) and if that fails immediately creates a new
        species.  In practice, methods 1 and 2 produce similar results, but
        method 1 can take a lot longer to run.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>SPECIES_PRINT</tt></b>
    <td>Toggle: Should new species be printed as soon as they are created?
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>TEST_CPU_TIME_MOD</tt></b>
    <td>Many of our analysis methods (such as species testing) require that
        we be able to run organisms in isolation.  Unfortunately, some of
        these organisms we test might be non-viable.  At some point, we have
        to give up the test and label it as non-viable, but we can't give up
        too soon or else we might miss a viable, though slow replicator.
        This setting is multiplied by the length of the organism's genome in
        order to determine how many CPU-cycles to run the organism for.  A
        setting of 20 effectively means that the average instruction must
        be executed twenty times before we give up.  In practice, most
        organisms have an efficiency here of about 5, so 20 works well, but
        for accurate tests on some pathological organisms, we will be
        required to raise this number.
<tr><td valign=top bgcolor="#AAFFAA"><b><tt>TRACK_MAIN_LINEAGE</tt></b>
    <td bgcolor="#AAFFAA">In a normal avida run, the genebank keeps track of all existing
        genotypes, and deletes them when the last organism of that genotype
        dies out.  With this flag set, a genotype will not be deleted unless
        both it and <i>all of its descendents</i> have died off.  This allows
        us to track back from any genotypes to its distant ancestors,
        monitoring all of the differences along the way.  Once this information
        is being saved, see the events file for how to output it.
</table>



<h3>Log Files</h3>

<p>
Log files are printed every time a specified event occurs.  By default,
all logs settings are 0 (i.e. the logs are turned off).  Each time a logged
event is printed, the update and identifying information on the individual
that triggered it is always included.  There are more entries listed in the
genesis file than here, but I think all of the rest are deprecated.

<p>
<table cellpadding=5 border=2>
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>LOG_CREATURES</tt></b>
    <td>If toggle is set, print an entry to "creature.log" whenever a new
        organism is born.  Include position information, parent organism, 
        and a link to it genotype so the run can be reconstructed.  This
        gets <i>very</i> large.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>LOG_GENOTYPES</tt></b>
    <td>If toggle is set, print an entry to "genotype.log" whenever a
        new genotype is created.  Includes information on its parent genotype.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>LOG_THRESHOLD</tt></b>
    <td>If toggle is set, print an entry to "threshold.log" whenever a
        genotype reaches threshold.  Includes information on what species it
        is.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>LOG_SPECIES</tt></b>
    <td>If toggle is set, print an entry to "species.log" whenever a new
        species is created.  Includes information on the genotype the
        triggered the creation.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>LOG_LINEAGES</tt></b>
    <td>Lineages can be given unique identifies and printed (into the file
        "lineage.log") whenever they are created.  Includes details about
        the event that created the lineage.
<tr><td valign=top><b><tt>LINEAGE_CREATION_METHOD</tt></b>
    <td>Details when lineages are created.  This should probably be listed in
        an earlier section, but there is way too much descriptive information
        in the genesis file that should probably go instead into a manual.
        Basically, this allows you to decide under exactly which conditions
        a new lineage will be created.  I'll let you read the genesis file
        itself to see the methods.
