      Synopsis: Control menu controls the Petri Dish View no matter what view you're in
      </p>

    <td>Unreleased revision 2705M.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>
      Synopsis: Importing and Exporting stopped working.
      </p>
      <p>
      Choosing Export <i>item</i> creates an empty <i>.aex</i> file. Import is
      not working for any items. Export and Import had been working previously,
      so this must be something that occurred in some recent build. Obviously
      fixing this has high priority.
