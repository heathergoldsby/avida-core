<h4>Changes in unreleased revision 2626M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Organism viewer: Bugfixed leftover out-of-date graphics in organism viewer.
  (Identified by Kaben Nanlohy; fixed by Kaben Nanlohy.)
    <ul>
      <li>
      Fixed bug where upon analysis of new organism, an invalid drag-and-drop
      grip circle for the previous daughter organism (if there was one) was not
      always deleted, and sometimes continued to appear and disappear when
      rolled-over with the mouse.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes in unreleased revision 2623M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Organism viewer: Added saving and printing of image of organism viewer.
  (Suggested by Robert Pennock; implemented by Kaben Nanlohy.)
    <ul>
      <li>
      Before either saving or printing, user is presented with a list of
      checkboxes corresponding to things to print: the organism, statistics
      about the organism, the organism timeline.
      </li>
      <li>
      When the user saves an image of the organism, the default file name
      includes the number of the organism's current execution step.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes in unreleased revision 2621M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Importing and exporting: Bugfixed importing and exporting of freezer items.
  (Identified by Robert Pennock; fixed by Kaben Nanlohy.)
    <ul>
      <li>
      Fixed bug where any kind of export produced empty files, and previously
      valid files of any kind could no longer be imported.
      </li>
      <li>
      To do (high priority): get a wider description of bug; check whether bug
      is fixed in all circumstances found by tester.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes in unreleased revision 2619M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  File menu: Now using Control-N instead of Shift-Control-N as the keyboard
  shortcut for New Workspace. (Suggested by Robert Pennock; implemented by
  Kaben Nanlohy.)
  </li>
  <li>
  Help viewer: Added keyboard shortcut to close help browser, and added "back",
  "forward", and "reload" buttons to help browser.  (Implemented by Kaben
  Nanlohy.)
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes in unreleased revision 2617M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Population viewer: In the color scale of the petri dish map legend, switched
  from three to four tick marks. (Suggested by Robert Pennock; implemented by
  Kaben Nanlohy.)
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes in unreleased revision 2615M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Help viewer: Added changelog and buglist. (Suggested by Robert Pennock;
  implemented by Kaben Nanlohy.)
    <ul>
      <li>
      Implemented as "Help" menu items "Changes..." and "Known Bugs...".
      Choosing either of these menu items will open a local web browser with a
      corresponding page written in HTML. In Mac OS X, These pages are stored
      in the folder "Avida-ED.app/Contents/Resources/documentation/".
      </li>
      <li>
      To do (low priority): these pages are awfully bare; some navigation links
      would be nice. History?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes in unreleased revision 2597M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Organism viewer: Demonstration of drag and drop from the organism viewer to the
  freezer. (Suggested by Robert Pennock; implemented by Kaben Nanlohy.)
    <ul>
      <li>
      In the org view, drag and drop can start any time the pointer is within
      the instruction circle of an organism of the right length. If the circle
      turns green, you can click and drag. If the circle of a child organism
      turns red, the organism is still too short.
      </li>
      <li>
      Sometimes you can find points in the timeline at which a child organism
      has the correct size but before the divide occurs. Drag and drop is
      allowed here. This means that some pathological things can happen: the
      child can be further altered, or the parent can alter itself; and the
      version of the parent that you drag and drop will be the one you're
      looking at right then. If you drag and drop later, you may get a
      different version stored in the freezer.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  Organism viewer: Proof-of-concept tooltip help system for organism
  instructions. (Implemented by Kaben Nanlohy.)
  </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
      A rollover "tooltip" mechanism is demonstrated when you place the mouse
      pointer above an instruction and then wait. This mechanism is flaky, and
      this flakiness might be a problem with Qt. We haven't found a way to fix
      it. It might be better to just leave it out.
      </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
