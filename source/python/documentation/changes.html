<h4>Changes included in unreleased revision 2619M:</h4>
<ul>

  Kaben Nanlohy.)
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes included in unreleased revision 2617M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>

  Nanlohy.)
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes included in unreleased revision 2615M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  General: Added changelog and buglist. (Suggested by Robert Pennock.
  Implemented by Kaben Nanlohy.)
    <ul>
      <li>
      Implemented as "Help" menu items "Changes..." and "Known Bugs...".
      Choosing either of these menu items will open a local web browser with a
      corresponding page written in HTML. In Mac OS X, These pages are stored
      in the folder "Avida-ED.app/Contents/Resources/documentation/".
      </li>
      <li>
      To do (low priority): These pages are awfully bare; some navigation links
      would be nice. History?
      </li>
    </ul>

</ul>


<h4>Changes included in unreleased revision 2597M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Organism viewer: Demonstration of drag and drop from the organism viewer to the
  freezer. (Suggested by Robert Pennock. Implemented by Kaben Nanlohy.)
    <ul>
      <li>
      In the org view, drag and drop can start any time the pointer is within
      the instruction circle of an organism of the right length. If the circle
      turns green, you can click and drag. If the circle of a child organism
      turns red, the organism is still too short.
      </li>
      <li>
      Sometimes you can find points in the timeline at which a child organism
      has the correct size but before the divide occurs. Drag and drop is
      allowed here. This means that some pathological things can happen: the
      child can be further altered, or the parent can alter itself; and the
      version of the parent that you drag and drop will be the one you're
      looking at right then. If you drag and drop later, you may get a
      different version stored in the freezer.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  Organism viewer: Proof-of-concept tooltip help system for organism
  instructions. (Implemented by Kaben Nanlohy.)
  </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
      A rollover "tooltip" mechanism is demonstrated when you place the mouse
      pointer above an instruction and then wait. This mechanism is flaky, and
      this flakiness might be a problem with Qt. We haven't found a way to fix
      it. It might be better to just leave it out.
      </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
