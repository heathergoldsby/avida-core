<h2>Recent changes to Avida-ED</h2>

<p>
Changes are listed by revision number.
</p>


<h4>Changes in unreleased revision 2712M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  File names: now using "avida_cfg" naming convention.
  (Suggested by Robert Pennock; implemented by Kaben Nanlohy.)
    <ul>
      <li>
        This maintains compatibility with previously saved workspaces: if files with new naming convention can't be found, old convention will be tried.
      </li>
      <li>
        I have not yet had the chance to rename c++ classes to use a similar naming convention.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes in unreleased revision 2709M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  File Dialogs: Bugfix: Switch the default export location from inside of the application bundle or workspace directory to the desktop.
  (Identified by Robert Pennock; fixed by Kaben Nanlohy.)
    <ul>
      <li>
        Application will try, in order, the last directory chosen if there is
        one, then the Desktop if it exists, then the Documents directory if it
        exists, then "My Documents" if it exists, and finally default to the
        original behavior.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes in unreleased revision 2706M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Control Menu: renamed menu items and changed keyboard shortcuts for
  population and organism viewers.
  (Suggested by Robert Pennock; implemented by Kaben Nanlohy.)
    <ul>
      <li>
      Renamed "Start" to "Run".
      </li>
      <li>
      Removed the keyboard shortcut "Command-R" for "Start New Experiment".
      </li>
      <li>
      Added keyboard shortcut "Command-R" for "Run", and "Space" for "Pause".
      Note: the keyboard shortcut "Space" doesn't appear in the menu item. I
      can't think of a way to fix this, because Qt seems to want to use a
      literal space, which is invisible.
      </li>
      <li>
      Added the keyboard shortcut "Command-T" (for "time") for the "Next Update / Next Instruction".
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes in unreleased revision 2705M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Control Menu: Fixed bug where the Control menu controlled the Petri Dish View
  no matter what view you're in.
  (Identified by Robert Pennock; fixed by Kaben Nanlohy.)
    <ul>
      <li>
      Gave each of the population, organism, and analysis views their own
      version of the Control Menu. The analysis view Control Menu contains a
      single disabled menu item reading "No controls available in Analysis
      View". The organism view Control Menu contains menu items "Start/Pause",
      "Next Instruction", "Previous Instruction", "Go To Start", and "Go To
      End".
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes in unreleased revision 2704M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Freezer: Changed the @example in the Configured Dishes shelf in the Freezer
  back to a world size of 30x30.
  (Suggested by Robert Pennock; implemented by Kaben Nanlohy.)
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes in revision 2668:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Freezer: Reordered File menu and corresponding rich-click dialog box in freezer.
  (Suggested by Robert Pennock; implemented by Kaben Nanlohy.)
    <ul>
      <li>
      New ordering of menu items and dialog-box radio buttons: Open, Rename,
      Export, Delete.
      </li>
      <li>
      To address concern of proximity of Delete to other menu items, inserted
      separator before Delete menu item.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes in unreleased revision 2666M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  File Menu and File Dialogs: Fixed bug where there's a missing confirm delete
  dialog upon deletion from freezer.  (Identified by Robert Pennock; fixed by
  Kaben Nanlohy.)
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes in unreleased revision 2665M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Freezer: Fixed bug where one shouldn't be able to delete items from the
  default workspace.  (Identified by Kaben Nanlohy; fixed by Kaben Nanlohy.)
    <ul>
      <li>
      If user is still using default workspace, right-clicks in freezer are
      intercepted, and a dialog box is show giving user option to create a new
      workspace, or open a new one.
      </li>
      <li>
      Similar interception if user tries to select "Delete..." or "Rename..."
      File menu items.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes in unreleased revision 2664M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Help Menu: Removed changelog and known-bugs; restored dialogs stating "help is being written".
  (Suggested by Robert Pennock; implemented by Kaben Nanlohy.)
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes in unreleased revision 2643:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  File Dialogs: Fixed problem with the order in which windows pop up when you export data.
  (Suggested by Robert Pennock; implemented by Brian Baer.)
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes in unreleased revision r2638:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  File Menu and File Dialogs: Changed some names and short cuts.
  (Suggested by Robert Pennock; implemented by Brian Baer.)
    <ul>
      <li>
      Renamed "Export Analysis" to "Export Data...", and "Save Images" to "Export Graphics...".

</ul>


<h4>Changes in unreleased revision 2629:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Default workspace: Change default array size in Avida-ED from 30 x 30 to 60 x 60.
  (Suggested by Robert Pennock; implemented by Brian Baer.)
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes in unreleased revision 2626M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Organism viewer: Bugfixed leftover out-of-date graphics in organism viewer.
  (Identified by Kaben Nanlohy; fixed by Kaben Nanlohy.)
    <ul>
      <li>
      Fixed bug where upon analysis of new organism, an invalid drag-and-drop
      grip circle for the previous daughter organism (if there was one) was not
      always deleted, and sometimes continued to appear and disappear when
      rolled-over with the mouse.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes in unreleased revision 2623M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Organism viewer: Added saving and printing of image of organism viewer.
  (Suggested by Robert Pennock; implemented by Kaben Nanlohy.)
    <ul>
      <li>
      Before either saving or printing, user is presented with a list of
      checkboxes corresponding to things to print: the organism, statistics
      about the organism, the organism timeline.
      </li>
      <li>
      When the user saves an image of the organism, the default file name
      includes the number of the organism's current execution step.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes in unreleased revision 2621M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Importing and exporting: Bugfixed importing and exporting of freezer items.
  (Identified by Robert Pennock; fixed by Kaben Nanlohy.)
    <ul>
      <li>
      Fixed bug where any kind of export produced empty files, and previously
      valid files of any kind could no longer be imported.
      </li>
      <li>
      To do (high priority): get a wider description of bug; check whether bug
      is fixed in all circumstances found by tester.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes in unreleased revision 2619M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  File menu: Now using Control-N instead of Shift-Control-N as the keyboard
  shortcut for New Workspace. (Suggested by Robert Pennock; implemented by
  Kaben Nanlohy.)
  </li>
  <li>
  Help viewer: Added keyboard shortcut to close help browser, and added "back",
  "forward", and "reload" buttons to help browser.  (Implemented by Kaben
  Nanlohy.)
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes in unreleased revision 2617M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Population viewer: In the color scale of the petri dish map legend, switched
  from three to four tick marks. (Suggested by Robert Pennock; implemented by
  Kaben Nanlohy.)
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes in unreleased revision 2615M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Help viewer: Added changelog and buglist. (Suggested by Robert Pennock;
  implemented by Kaben Nanlohy.)
    <ul>
      <li>
      Implemented as "Help" menu items "Changes..." and "Known Bugs...".
      Choosing either of these menu items will open a local web browser with a
      corresponding page written in HTML. In Mac OS X, These pages are stored
      in the folder "Avida-ED.app/Contents/Resources/documentation/".
      </li>
      <li>
      To do (low priority): these pages are awfully bare; some navigation links
      would be nice. History?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Changes in unreleased revision 2597M:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Organism viewer: Demonstration of drag and drop from the organism viewer to the
  freezer. (Suggested by Robert Pennock; implemented by Kaben Nanlohy.)
    <ul>
      <li>
      In the org view, drag and drop can start any time the pointer is within
      the instruction circle of an organism of the right length. If the circle
      turns green, you can click and drag. If the circle of a child organism
      turns red, the organism is still too short.
      </li>
      <li>
      Sometimes you can find points in the timeline at which a child organism
      has the correct size but before the divide occurs. Drag and drop is
      allowed here. This means that some pathological things can happen: the
      child can be further altered, or the parent can alter itself; and the
      version of the parent that you drag and drop will be the one you're
      looking at right then. If you drag and drop later, you may get a
      different version stored in the freezer.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  Organism viewer: Proof-of-concept tooltip help system for organism
  instructions. (Implemented by Kaben Nanlohy.)
  </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
      A rollover "tooltip" mechanism is demonstrated when you place the mouse
      pointer above an instruction and then wait. This mechanism is flaky, and
      this flakiness might be a problem with Qt. We haven't found a way to fix
      it. It might be better to just leave it out.
      </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
