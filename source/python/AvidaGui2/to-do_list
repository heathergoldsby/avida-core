************Jeff*******************

Priority High
-make the org report give the name of the ancestor when they are clicked on (pre-run)
-get rid of genome length map mode, the graph mode, and stat view
-work with brian to get delete working on the front of the dish (either by taking it to the can or hitting the delete key)
-fix the problem where the arrows are pushed off the edge (talk with josh to make it happen)
-add a None option to the analyze population color list 
-reformat the org stat viewer so that it matches the buttons format of the task view 
-add ancestor to the org_clicked_on report during the run
-make a ancestor graph viewer mode (to see who is winning the head to head comparisons)
-fix the fact that the scroll bars are too highin the ancestor legend if you add a lot of orgs  


Priority Medium

-get rid of the QT buttons warnings you generated
-Use warning system
   -make a warning that says you can't drag orgs into this view (1/26/06)
   -the "that was a bad path" or "file does not exist" warnings for dragging and dropping should use this (10/01/05)
-add the ability to drag things into the menu blocks (e.g. drag into the organism tab in the top left corner) (1/30/05)
-right clicking on things as much as possible (1/30/05)

-Remove doubleclick from freezer items (3/07/06)

Priority Low
-color the scales (1/10/05)
-make the getting rid of the outline of the cells something that doesn't slow down the code at every step


************Kaben******************



Priority High-
- rotate child organism back to standard position after divide in organism viewer.
- independant random number generator for test cpu.
  - be able to set a private random number generator.
- default 0.02 (1 genomic) mutation rate in organism viewer.
- optionally force exactly one mutation in organism viewer.
  - subsequently, able to drag child organism back into freezer or dish.

- meet with josh to automate windows, linux builds

- use test cpu to analyze initial population in petri dish so that we
  can properly color everyone.

- calculate child statistics and use them in the place of parent stats,
  which will be perhaps less confusing to user.

- dynamic choice of fonts, scrollbars, window sizes, as needed for
  platform, display size.

- reenable buildbot
- emails on new release
- new-style application icon
- replace flip arrow on petri dish with a button with text reading
  "configure"

- troubleshoot crash on run end, as set in petri dish control.
  - hack with a pause signal upon a certain event completed.
- toggle to see legend instruction names to colors
- toggle to see letters

- in petri dish, indication of each mutation as it occurs.
- see tasks on timeline (josh)

Priority Medium-
- animation of organism divide
- run things throught the test cpus (so we can accurately paint loaded
  dishes and so the graphs have good data from the get go)
- change the text in analyze mode to list the population instead of what
  it currently state (12/21/05)
- check why repeatablity does not repeat
- check why program runs so much when program is paused

Priority Low-


************Josh*******************

12-Jun-06 Fix color printing in graph

12-Jun-06 Add documentation about saving and exporting excel data and images

08-Jun-06 Add printing/saving images to organism and population stats view.

-Scroll bars are working again (though hard coded)
-Scroll bars are now dynamic (30th)
-fix the bugs with the lineage label (typically full petri dish)


July

-fix the prerun crashes for clicking around petri dish ancestors
-fix the problem that the gray outline of ancestors is going away if they are clicked on then off again pre-run


August
-a user can now click on a button on the population stats report and all the organisms that are doing that task are highlighted (works with multiple tasks at once, showing the overlap)
-work continues on the ancestor map mode=======
-fix the prerun crashes for clicking around petri dish ancestors
-fix the problem that the gray outline of ancestors is going away if they are clicked on then off again pre-run
-made the highlight of the clicked on cell twice as thick
-ancestor map mode now loads the names of the organisms and has the size of the name label correctly, scrolling also works, but the color of the ancestor is not being painted correctly (and the layout needs to be improved)
