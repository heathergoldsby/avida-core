Priority High
-When I click on an org the color block, name and stats for that org 
come up correctly (or at least I assume they are correct).  However, 
on my version the color block, name and stats stay the same even when 
the org on the petri dish changes.  If I click on the org in question 
the stats are updated.
-work with brian to get delete working on the front of the dish (either by taking it to the can or hitting the delete key)
-fix the problem where the arrows are pushed off the edge (talk with josh to make it happen)
-add a None option to the analyze population color list 
-reformat the org stat viewer so that it matches the buttons format of the task view 
-make a ancestor graph viewer mode (to see who is winning the head to head comparisons)
-fix the fact that the scroll bars are too highin the ancestor legend if you add a lot of orgs  


Priority Medium

-get rid of the QT buttons warnings you generated
-Use warning system
   -make a warning that says you can't drag orgs into this view (1/26/06)
   -the "that was a bad path" or "file does not exist" warnings for dragging and dropping should use this (10/01/05)
-add the ability to drag things into the menu blocks (e.g. drag into the organism tab in the top left corner) (1/30/05)
-right clicking on things as much as possible (1/30/05)

-Remove doubleclick from freezer items (3/07/06)

Priority Low
-color the scales (1/10/05)
-make the getting rid of the outline of the cells something that doesn't slow down the code at every step


************Kaben******************

June
-Petri dish now outlines the organisms that are about to start that run
-Scroll bars are working again (though hard coded)
-Scroll bars are now dynamic (30th)
-fix the bugs with the lineage label (typically full petri dish)
-get rid of genome length map mode, the graph mode, and stat view


July

-fix the prerun crashes for clicking around petri dish ancestors
-fix the problem that the gray outline of ancestors is going away if they are clicked on then off again pre-run


August
-a user can now click on a button on the population stats report and all the organisms that are doing that task are highlighted (works with multiple tasks at once, showing the overlap)
-work continues on the ancestor map mode=======
-fix the prerun crashes for clicking around petri dish ancestors
-fix the problem that the gray outline of ancestors is going away if they are clicked on then off again pre-run
-made the highlight of the clicked on cell twice as thick
-ancestor map mode now loads the names of the organisms and has the size of the name label correctly, scrolling also works, but the color of the ancestor is not being painted correctly (and the layout needs to be improved)
--make tasks reflect parent tasks (not real time) in org report (pending group decision) (1/26/06)
-bring the ability to see the org square outlined in gray back (works now)
-ancestor legend view now works

November:
-Fixed: A new run will not start from initial conditions if the Petri Dish view is set to "None".
