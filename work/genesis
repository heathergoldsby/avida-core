# This file includes all the run-time defines...
VERSION_ID 1.3		# Do not change this value!

### Architecture Variables ###
MAX_UPDATES 50000	# Maximum updates to run simulation.
WORLD-X 60		# Width of the world in Avida mode.
WORLD-Y 60		# Height of the world in Avida mode.
MAX_CPU_THREADS 1	# Number of Threads CPU's can spawn
RANDOM_SEED 0		# Random number seed. (0 for based on time)

### Configuration Files ###
DEFAULT_DIR ../work/    # Directory in which config files can be found.
INST_SET inst_set.28.base # File containing instruction set.
TASK_SET task_set       # File containing task set.
EVENT_FILE event_list   # File containing list of events during run.
START_CREATURE genebank/creature.base   # Creature to seed the soup.

### Viewer ###
VIEW_MODE 1		# 0=BLANK, 1=MAP, 2=STATS, 3=HIST, 4=OPTIONS, 5=ZOOM

### Reproduction ###
BIRTH_METHOD 1		# 0 = Choose Random Creature (poor for evolution!)
			# 1 = Choose Oldest Creature
			# 2 = Choose largest Age/Merit
			# 3 = Choose only empty cells.
			# 4 = Choose Random from entire soup (Mass Action)
			# 5 = Choose Eldest from entire soup (Tierra)
DEATH_METHOD 0          # 0 = Never kill creatures.
			# 1 = Kill when inst executed = AGE_LIMIT
			# 2 = Kill when inst executed = length * AGE_LIMIT
AGE_LIMIT 5000            # Modifies DEATH_METHOD
ALLOC_METHOD 0          # 0 = Allocated space is set to default instruction.
                        # 1 = Set to section of other creatures (Necrophilia)

### Divide Restrictions ####
CHILD_SIZE_RANGE 2.0    # Maximal differential between child and parent sizes.

### Mutations ###
POINT_MUT_PROB  0.0     # Mutation rate (per-location per update) 
COPY_MUT_PROB   0.005   # Mutation rate (per copy).
DIVIDE_MUT_PROB 0.0     # Mutation rate (per divide).
DIVIDE_INS_PROB 0.05    # Insertion rate (per divide).
DIVIDE_DEL_PROB 0.05    # Deletion rate (per divide).

### Time Slicing ###
AVE_TIME_SLICE 30
SLICING_METHOD 3	# 0 = CONSTANT: all creatures get default...
			# 1 = BLOCK: Block slice scaled to merit.
			# 2 = PROBABILISTIC: Run _prob_ proportional to merit.
			# 3 = INTEGRATED: Perfectly integrated deterministic.
SIZE_MERIT_METHOD 4	# 0 = off (merit is independent of size)
			# 1 = Merit proportional to copied size
			# 2 = Merit prop. to executed size.
			# 3 = Merit prop. to full size.
			# 4 = Merit prop. to min of executed or copied size.
			# 5 = Merit prop. to sqrt of the minimum size.
TASK_MERIT_METHOD 1	# 0 = No task bonuses
			# 1 = Bonus just equals the task bonus

### Genotype Info ###
THRESHOLD 3		# Number of creatures in a genotype needed for it
			#   to be considered viable.
GENOTYPE_PRINT 0	# 0/1 (off/on) Print out all threshold genotypes?
SPECIES_PRINT 0		# 0/1 (off/on) Print out all species?
GENOTYPE_PRINT_DOM 0	# Print out a genotype if it stays dominant for
                        #   this many updates. (0 = off)
SPECIES_RECORDING 2	# 1 = full, 2 = limited search (parent only)
SPECIES_THRESHOLD 2     # max number of failures creatures to be same species
