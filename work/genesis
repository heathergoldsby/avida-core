### Architecture Variables ###
MODE 2			# 1 = Tierra, 2 = Avida
MAX_UPDATES 50000       # Maximum updates to run simulation.
WORLD_SIZE 3600		# Number of creatures in Tierra mode.
WORLD-X 60		# Width of the world in Avida mode.
WORLD-Y 60		# Height of the world in Avida mode.
RANDOM_SEED 0           # Random number seed. (0 for based on time)

### Configuration Files ###
DEFAULT_DIR ../work/    # Directory in which config files can be found.
INST_SET inst_set.24.base # File containing instruction set.
TASK_SET task_set       # File containing task set.
EVENT_FILE event_list   # File containing list of events during run.

### Viewer ###
VIEW_MODE 1		# 0=BLANK, 1=MAP, 2=STATS, 3=HIST, 4=OPTIONS, 5=ZOOM

### Reproduction ###
BIRTH_METHOD 1		# 0 = Choose Random Creature (poor for evolution!)
			# 1 = Choose Oldest Creature
			# 2 = Choose largest Age/Merit
			# 3 = Choose only empty cells.
DEATH_METHOD 0          # 0 = Never kill creatures.
			# 1 = Kill when inst executed = AGE_LIMIT
			# 2 = Kill when inst executed = length * AGE_LIMIT
AGE_LIMIT 16            # Modifies DEATH_METHOD

### Mutations ###
POINT_MUT_RATE   0      # Mutation rate (per-location per update) (x10^-6)
COPY_MUT_RATE    50     # Mutation rate (per copy).    (x10^-4)
DIVIDE_MUT_RATE  0      # Mutation rate (per divide).  (x10^-2)
DIVIDE_INS_RATE  5      # Insertion rate (per divide). (x10^-2)
DIVIDE_DEL_RATE  5      # Deletion rate (per divide).  (x10^-2)

### Time Slicing ###
AVE_TIME_SLICE 30
SLICING_METHOD 3	# 0 = CONSTANT: all creatures get default...
			# 1 = BLOCK: Block slice scaled to merit.
			# 2 = PROBABILISTIC: Run _prob_ proportional to merit.
			# 3 = INTEGRATED: Perfectly integrated deterministic.
SIZE_MERIT_METHOD 4	# 0 = off (merit is independent of size)
			# 1 = Merit proportional to copied size
			# 2 = Merit prop. to executed size.
			# 3 = Merit prop. to full size.
			# 4 = Merit prop. to min of executed or copied size.
TASK_MERIT_METHOD 1	# 0/1  off or on.  (off removes bonuses for tasks).

			#   to be considered viable.
GENOTYPE_PRINT 0	# 0/1 (off/on) Print out all threshold genotypes?
SPECIES_PRINT 0		# 0/1 (off/on) Print out all species?
GENOTYPE_PRINT_DOM 0	# Print out a genotype if it stays dominant for
                        #   this many updates. (0 = off)
SPECIES_RECORDING 2	# 1 = full, 2 = limited search (parent only)
SPECIES_THRESHOLD 2     # max number of failures creatures to be same species
