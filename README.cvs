If you got the Avida source from the cvs repository, you have to 
do 'make -f Makefile.cvs' the first time you want to compile Avida.
You need autoconf and automake installed on your machine in order for 
that to work. 

'make -f Makefile.cvs' builds the configure script from configure.in. 
After this has happened, you can continue as described in the file 'README'.
