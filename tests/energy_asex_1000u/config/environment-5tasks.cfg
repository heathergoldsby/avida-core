# This is the setup file for the task/resource system.  From here, you can
# setup the available resources (including their inflow and outflow rates) as
# well as the reactions that the organisms can trigger by performing tasks.
#
# This file is currently setup to reward 9 tasks, all of which use the
# "infinite" resource, which is undepletable.
#
# For information on how to use this file, see:  doc/environment.html

# sun_light resource with intial value of ON.  Resource is binary in above paper.
RESOURCE sun_light:initial=1.0


# Available reactions.
# Note 2 things:
# 1. sun_light is required for every reaction.  However, when sun_light is ON it is a non-depletable/infinite resource.
# 2. The value of the simpler tasks are less, however the simpler tasks can be performed more. 
#    Basically, the organsisms can feed on many different things when the resource is ON and nothing when its OFF.
