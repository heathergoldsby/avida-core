<h1>Template</h1>

A template (sometimes called a label) is a sequence of <a href="help.nop-instructions.html">no-operation</a>  instructions used to mark regions of code within a <a href="help.Genome.html">genome</a>. Some instructions (such a <a href="help.h-search.html">h-search</a>) are followed by a template; the <a href="help.Complement-Template.html">complement</a>  of that template is then used to match against other templates. See the descriptions of the individual <a href="help.Instruction.html">instructions</a>  for how they use templates.
