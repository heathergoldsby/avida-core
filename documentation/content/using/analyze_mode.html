<h2 align=center>The Analyze File</h2>

<p>
The file "<tt>analyze.cfg</tt>" is used to setup avida when its in
analysis-only mode, which can be done by running "avida -a".  It is used to
perform additional tests on genotypes after a run has completed.

<p>
This analysis language is basically a simple programming language.  The
structure of a program involves loading in genotypes in one or more
"batches", and then either manipulating single batches, or doing comparisons
between batches.  Currently there can be up to 300 batches of genotypes, but
we will eventually remove this limit.

<p>
The rest of this file describes how individual commands work, as well
as some notes on other languages features, like how to use variables.  As
a formatting guide, command arguments will be presented between brackets,
such as [<font color="#0000AA">filename</font>].  If that argument is
mandatory, it will be in blue.  If it is optional, it will be in green, and
(if relevant) a default value will be listed, such as
[<font color="#008800">filename="output.dat"</font>]

<p>
There are currently six ways to load in genotypes:

<p align=center><b>Table 1: <font color="#008800">Genotype Loading Commands</font></b>
<table cellpadding=6>
<tr><td><b>LOAD_ORGANISM [<font color="#0000AA">filename</font>]</b><br>
    	Load in a normal single-organism file of the type that is output
        from avida.  These consist of lots of organismal information inside
        of comments, and then the full genome of the organism with one
        instruction per line.
<tr><td><b>LOAD_BASE_DUMP [<font color="#0000AA">filename</font>]</b><br>
	Load in a basic dump file from avida.  Each line contains a genotype
        sequence, but little additional information.
<tr><td><b>LOAD_DETAIL_DUMP [<font color="#0000AA">filename</font>]</b><br>
	Load in a detail file.  These are similar to the basic dump files,
        but contain a lot more information on each line.  These files are
        saved from avida typically beginning with the word "detail" or
        "historic".
<tr><td><b>LOAD [<font color="#0000AA">filename</font>]</b><br>
	Load in a file. This command LOAD_BASE_DUMP and LOAD_DETAIL_DUMP 
	by automatically recognizing the type of the file being loaded. 
<tr><td><b>LOAD_SEQUENCE [<font color="#0000AA">sequence</font>]</b><br>
	Load in a user-provided sequence as the genotype.  Avida has a
        symbol associated with each instruction; this command is simply
        followed by a sequence of such symbols that is than translated back
        into a proper genotype.
<tr><td><b>LOAD_MULTI_DETAIL [<font color="#0000AA">start-UD</font>] [<font color="#0000AA">step-UD</font>] [<font color="#0000AA">stop-UD</font>] [<font color="#008800">dir='./'</font>] [<font color="#008800">start batch=0</font>]</b><br>
   Allows the user to load in multiple detail files at once, one per
   batch.  This is helpful when you're trying to do parallel analysis
   on many detail files, or else to create a phylogenetic depth map.<br>

   Example: <tt>LOAD_MULTI_DETAIL 100 100 100000 ../my_run/run100/</tt><br>

   This would load in the files detail_pop.100 through detail_pop.100000 
   in steps of 100, from the directory of my choosing.  Since 1000 files will
   be loaded and we didn't specify starting batch, they will be put in
   batches 0 through 999.


</table>

<p>
A future addition to this list is a command that will use the "dominant.dat"
file to identify all of the dominant genotypes from a run, and then lookup and
load their individual genomes from the genebank directory.  Also, the
commands LOAD_BASE_DUMP and LOAD_DETAIL_DUMP currently require fixed-formated
files.  New output files from avida have tags listed for their column names,
and as such we already have a working prototype of a generic "LOAD" command
that will figure out the file format and be able to load in all of the data
properly.

<p>
All of the load commands place the new genotypes into the "current" batch,
which can be set with the "SET_BATCH" command.  Below is the list of control
functions that allow you to manipulate the batches.

<p align=center><b>Table 2: <font color="#008800">Batch Control Commands</font></b>
<table cellpadding=6>
<tr><td><b>SET_BATCH [<font color="#0000AA">id</font>]</b><br>
    	Set the batch that is currently active; the initial active batch
        at the start of a program is 0.
<tr><td><b>NAME_BATCH [<font color="#0000AA">name</font>]</b><br>
    	Attach a name to the current batch.  Some of the printing methods
        will print data from multiple batches, and we want the data from each
        batch to be attached to a meaningful identifier.
<tr><td><b>PURGE_BATCH [<font color="#008800">id=current</font>]</b><br>
    	Remove all genotypes in the specified batch (if no argument is given,
        the current batch is purged.
<tr><td><b>DUPLICATE [<font color="#0000AA">id1</font>]
        [<font color="#008800">id2=current</font>]</b><br>
    	Copy the genotypes from batch id1 into id2.  By default,
        copy id1 into the current batch.  Note that duplicate is
        <i>non-destructive</i> so you should purge the target batch first if
        you don't want to just add more genotypes to the ones already in
        that batch.
<tr><td><b>STATUS</b><br>
    	Print out (to the screen) the genotype count of each non-empty batch
        and identify the currently active batch.
</table>

<p>
There are several other commands that will allow you to interact with the
analysis mode in some very important ways, but don't actually trigger any
analysis tests or output.  Below are a list of some of the more important
control commands.
        
<p align=center><b>Table 3: <font color="#008800">More Analysis Control Commands</font></b>
<table cellpadding=6>
<tr><td><b>VERBOSE </b><br>
    	Toggle verbose/minimal messages.  Verbose messages will print all
        of the details of what is happening to the screen.  Minimal messages
        will only briefly state the process being run.  Verbose messages are
        recommended if you're in interactive mode.
<tr><td><b>SYSTEM [<font color="#0000AA">command</font>]</b><br>
    	Run the command listed on the command line.  This is particularly
        useful if you need to unzip files before you can use them, or if
        you want to delete files no longer in use.
<tr><td><b>INCLUDE [<font color="#0000AA">filename</font>]</b><br>
    	Include another file into this one and run its contents immediately.
        This is useful if you have some pre-written routines that you want
        to have available in several analysis files.  Watch out because there
        are currently no protections against circular includes.
<tr><td><b>INTERACTIVE</b><br>
    	Place Avida analysis into interactive mode so that you can type
        commands have have them immediately acted upon.  You can place this
        anywhere within the analyze file, so that you can have some
        processing done before interactive mode starts.  You can type "quit"
        at any point to continue with the normal processing of the file.
<tr><td><b>DEBUG [<font color="#0000AA">message</font>] </b><br>
        <b>ECHO [<font color="#0000AA">message</font>] </b><br>
    	These are both "echo" commands that will print a message (the
        arguments given) onto the screen.  If there are any variables (see
        below) in the message, they will be translated before printing, so
        this is a good way of debugging your programs.
</table>

<p>
Now that we know how to interact with analysis mode, and load in genotypes,
its important to be able to manipulate them.  The next batch of commands
will do basic analysis on genotypes, and allow the user to prune batches
to only include those genotypes that are needed.


<p align=center><b>Table 4: <font color="#008800">Genotype Manipulation Commands</font></b>
<table cellpadding=6>
<tr><td><b>RECALCULATE [<font color="#008800">use_resources=0</font>]</b><br>
    	Run all of the genotypes in the current batch through a test CPU
	and record the measurements taken (fitness, gestation time, etc.).
        This overrides any values that may have been loaded in with the
        genotypes.  The use_resources flags signifies whether or not the
        test cpu will use resources when it runs.  For more information 
        on resources, see the <a href="#USING_RESOURCES">summary</a> below.
<tr><td><b>FIND_GENOTYPE [<font color="#008800">type="num_cpus" ...</font>]</b><br>
    	Remove all genotypes but the one selected.  Type indicates which
	genotype to choose.  Options available for type are "num_cpus" (to
        choose the genotype with the maximum organismal abundance at time of
        printing), "total_cpus" (number of organisms ever of this genotype),
        "fitness", or "merit".  If a the type entered is numerical, it is
        used as an id number to indicate the desired genotype (if no such id
        exists, a warning will be given).  Multiple arguments can be given to
        this command, in which case all those genotypes in that list will be
        preserved and the remainder deleted.
<tr><td><b>FIND_ORGANISM [<font color="#008800">random</font>]</b><br>
	Picks out a random organism from the population and removes all 
	others. It is different from FIND_GENOTYPE because it takes into 
	account relative number of organisms within each genotype. To pick 
	more than one organisms, list the word 'random' multiple times. This 
	is essentially sampling without replacement from the population.
<tr><td><b>FIND_LINEAGE [<font color="#008800">type="num_cpus"</font>] </b><br>
    	Delete everything except the lineage from the chosen genotype back
	to the most distant ancestor available.  This command will only
        function properly if parental information was loaded in with the
        genotypes.  Type is the same as the FIND_GENOTYPE command.
<tr><td><b>FIND_SEX_LINEAGE [<font color="#008800">type="num_cpus"</font>] 
	[<font color="#008800">parent_method="rec_region_size"</font>] </b><br>
    	Delete everything except the lineage from the chosen genotype back
	to the most distant ancestor available. Similar to FIND_LINEAGE but 
	works in sexual populations. To simplify things, only maternal lineage plus
	immediate fathers are saved, i.e. info about father's parents is discarded. 
	The second option, parent_method, determines which parent is considered the 
	"mother" in each particular recombination. If parent_method is "rec_region_size" :
        "mother" is the parent contributing more code to the offspring genome 
	(default); if it's "genome_size", "mother" is the parent with the longer 
	genome, no matter how much of it was contributed to the offspring. 
	This command will only function properly if parental information was 
	loaded in with the genotypes.  Type is the same as the FIND_GENOTYPE command.
<tr><td><b>ALIGN</b><br>
    	Create an alignment of all the genome's sequences; It will place '_'s
        in the sequences to show the alignment.  Note that a "FIND_LINEAGE"
        must first be run on the batch in order for the alignment to be
        possible.
<tr><td><b>SAMPLE_ORGANISMS [<font color="#0000AA">fraction</font>]
	[<font color="#008800">test_viable=0</font>] </b><br>
    	Keep only "fraction" of organisms in the current batch.  This
	is done per organism, <i>not</i> per genotype.  Thus, genotypes of high
	abundance may only have their abundance lowered, while genotypes
	of abundance 1 will either stay or be removed entirely. If test_viable is
	set to 1, sample only from the viable organisms. 
<tr><td><b>SAMPLE_GENOTYPES [<font color="#0000AA">fraction</font>]
	[<font color="#008800">test_viable=0</font>] </b><br>
    	Keep only fraction of genotypes in the current batch. If test_viable is
        set to 1, sample only from the viable genotypes. 
<tr><td><b>RENAME [<font color="#008800">start_id=0</font>]</b><br>
    	Change the id numbers of all the genotypes to start at a given value.
        Often in long runs we will be dealing with ID's in the millions.  In
        particular, after reducing a batch to a lineage, we will often want
        to number the genotypes in order from the ancestor to the final one.
</table>

<p>
Next, we are going to look at the standard output commands that will used to
save information generated in analyze mode.


<p align=center><b>Table 5: <font color="#008800">Basic Output Commands</font></b>
<table cellpadding=6>
<tr><td><b>PRINT [<font color="#008800">dir="genebank/"</font>] 
	[<font color="#008800">filename</font>] </b><br>
    	Print the genotypes from the current batch as individual files (one
        genotype per file) in the directory given. If no filename is specified,  
	the files will be named by the genotype name, with a ".gen" appended to 
	them. Specifying the filename is useful when printing a single genotype. 
<tr><td><b>TRACE [<font color="#008800">dir="genebank/"</font>] [ <font color="#008800">use_resources=0</font>] </b><br>
    	Trace all of the genotypes and print a listing of their execution.
	This will show step-by-step the status of all of the CPU components
	and the genome during the course of the execution.  The filename used
	for each trace will be the genotype's name with a ".trace" appended.
	The use resources flag signifies whether or not the test cpu will use
        resources when it runs.  For more information on resources, see the 
        <a href="#USING_RESOURCES">summary</a> below.
<tr><td><b>PRINT_TASKS [<font color="#008800">file="tasks.dat"</font>] </b><br>
    	This will print out the tasks doable by each genotype, one per line
	in the output file specified.  Note that this information must either
	have been loaded in, or a RECALCULATE must have been run to collect
	it.
<tr><td><b>DETAIL [<font color="#008800">file="detail.dat"</font>] [<font color="#008800">format ...</font>]</b><br>
    	Print out all of the stats for each genotype, one per line.  The
	format indicates the layout of columns in the file.  If the filename
	specified ends in ".html", html formatting will be used instead of
	plain text.  For the format, see the section on "Output Formats"
	below.
<tr><td><b>DETAIL_TIMELINE [<font color="#008800">file="detail_timeline.dat"</font>] 
	[<font color="#008800">time_step=100</font>]
	[<font color="#008800">max_time=100000</font>]</b><br> 
	Details a time-sequence of dump files. 
<tr><td><b>DETAIL_BATCHES [<font color="#008800">file="detail_baches.dat"</font>]
	[<font color="#008800">format ...</font>]</b><br>
        Details all batches. 
<tr><td><b>DETAIL_INDEX [<font color="#0000AA">file</font>]
	[<font color="#0000AA">min_batch</font>] [<font color="#0000AA">max_batch</font>]
	[<font color="#008800">format ...</font>]</b><br>
	Detail all the batches between min_batch and max_batch. 
<tr><td><b>DETAIL_AVERAGE [<font color="#008800">file="detail.dat"</font>] 
	[<font color="#008800">format ...</font>]</b><br>
	Detail the current batch, but print out the average for each argument, as opposed to the 
	individual values for each genotype, the way DETAIL would. Arguments are the same as for DETAIL. 
	it takes into account the relative abundance of each genotype in the batch when calculating the 
	averages. 
</table>

<p>
And at last, we have the actual analysis commands that perform tests on
the data and output the results.

<p align=center><b>Table 6: <font color="#008800">Analysis Commands</font></b>
<table cellpadding=6>
<tr><td><b>LANDSCAPE [<font color="#008800">file="landscape.dat"</font>]
	[<font color="#008800">dist=1</font>]
	[<font color="#008800">nume_test=(all)</font>]</b><br>
    	For each genotype in the current batch, test all possible mutations
	(or combinations of mutations if dist > 1) and summarize the results,
	one per line in the specified file.
	If <b>nume_test</b> is specified, randomly pick that many mutants
	to test, instead of testing all (important for large <b>dist</b>) 
<tr><td><b>ANALYZE_EPISTASIS [<font color="#008800">file="epistasis.dat"</font>]
	[<font color="#008800">num_test=(all)</font>]</b><br>
    	For each genotype in the current batch, test possible 
	double mutatants, and single mutations composing them; print both of 
	individual relative fitnesses and the double mutant relative fitness. 
	By default all double mutants are tested. If in a hurry, specify the 
	number to be tested (<b>num_test</b>)
<tr><td><b>MAP_TASKS [<font color="#008800">dir="phenotype/"</font>]
	[<font color="#008800">flags ...</font>]
	[<font color="#008800">format ...</font>] </b><br>
    	Construct a genotype-phenotype array for each genotype in the
	current batch.  The format is the list of stats that you want
	to include as columns in the array.  Additionally you can have
	special format flags; the possible flags are "html" to print output
	in HTML format, and "link_maps" to create html links between
	consecutive genotypes in a lineage.
<tr><td><b>MAP_MUTATIONS [<font color="#008800">dir="mutations/"</font>]
	[<font color="#008800">flags ...</font>] </b><br>
    	Construct a genome-mutation array for each genotype in the
	current batch.  The format has each line in the genome as a row
        in the chart, and all available instructions representing the columns.
        The cells in the chart indicate the fitness were a mutation to
        occur at the position in the matrix, to the listed instruction.
        If the "html" flag is used, the charts will be output in HTML format.
<tr><td><b>MAP_DEPTH [<font color="#008800">filename='depth_map.dat'</font>] [<font color="#008800">min_batch=0</font>] [<font color="#008800">max_batch=cur_batch-1</font>]</b><br>
       This will create a depth map (like those we use for phylogeny
       visualization) in the filename specified.  You can direct which
       batches to take this from, but by default it will work perfectly after
       a LOAD_MULTI_DETAIL.

    
<tr><td><b>AVERAGE_MODULATITY [<font color="#008800">file="modularity.dat"</font>]
	[<font color="#008800">task.0 task.1 task.2 task.3 task.4 task.5      
	task.6 task.7 task.8</font>] </b><br>
    	Calculate several modularity measuers, such as how many tasks is an 
	instruction involved in, number of sites required for each task, etc.
	The measures are averaged over all the organisms in the current batch 
	that perform any tasks. For the full output list, do 
	"AVERAGE_MODULATITY legend.dat" At the moment doesn't support html
	output format and works with only 1 and 2 input tasks. 
<tr><td><b>HAMMING [<font color="#008800">file="hamming.dat"</font>]
	[<font color="#008800">b1=current</font>]
	[<font color="#008800">b2=b1</font>] </b><br>
    	Calculate the hamming distance between batches b1 and b2.  If only
	one batch is given, calculations are on all pairs within that batch.
<tr><td><b>LEVENSTEIN [<font color="#008800">file="lev.dat"</font>]
	[<font color="#008800">batch1</font>]
	[<font color="#008800">b2=b1</font>]</b><br>
    	Calculate the levenstein distance (edit distance) between batches b1
	and b2.  This metric is similar to hamming distance, but calculates
	the minimum number of single insertions, deletions, and mutations to
	move from one sequence to the other.
<tr><td><b>LEVENSTEIN_SINGLE [<font color="#008800">file="lev.dat"</font>]
	Variation on above. Calculate Levenstein distance between the first 
	(usually most abundant sequence) in the batch and all other sequences
	in the batch. Useful for calculating "population epistasis".     	
<tr><td><b>SPECIES [<font color="#008800">file="species.dat"</font>]
	[<font color="#0000AA">bach1</font>]
	[<font color="#0000AA">bach2</font>]
        [<font color="#0000AA">num_recombinants</font>]</b><br>
	Calculates the percentage of non-viable recombinants between all 
	pairs of organisms from batches 1 and 2. Number of random recombination 
	events for each pair of organisms is specified by num_recombinants.
	Recombination is done in the same way as in the birth chamber when 
	divide-sex is executed. <br>

	[<font color="#0000AA">num_recombinants</font>]</b><br>
	Similar to Species command, but instead of calculating things on the spot, 
	just create all the recombinant genotypes using organisms from baches 1 and 2
	and put them in the batch3.

<a name="USING_RESOURCES"></a>
<h3>Using Test CPU Resources Summary</h3>
<p>
This summary is given to help explain the use and constraints for using resources.

<p>
When a command specifies the use of resources for the test cpu, it should not
affect the state of the test cpu after the command has finished.  However, this 
means that the test cpu is no longer guaranteed to be reentrant.  Each command 
will set up the environment and the resource count in the test cpu with it's own 
environment and resource count.  When the command has finished it will set the the 
test cpu's environment and resource count back to what they were before the command 
was executed.

<p>
Resource usage for the test cpu occurs by setting the environment and then 
setting up the resource count using the environment.  Once the resource 
count has been set up, it will not change during the use of the test cpu.  
When an organism performs and IO, completing a task, the concentrations are 
not changed.  This was a design decision, but is easily changed.

<p>
In analyze, a new data structure was included which contains a time ordered 
list of resource concentrations.  This list can be used to set up resources 
from different time points.  By using the FillResources function, you can 
have the resource library updated with resource concentrations from a time 
point closest to the user specified time point.  If the LOAD_RESOURCES 
command is not called, the list defaults to a single entry which is the 
the initial concentrations of the resources specified in the environment 
configuration file.

<p align=center><b>Table 7: <font color="#008800">Test CPU Resource Related Commands</font></b>
<table cellpadding=6>
<tr><td><b>PRINT_TEST_CPU_RESOURCES </b><br>
    	This command first prints the whether or not the test cpu is using 
        resources.  Then it will print the concentration for each resource.
<tr><td><b>LOAD_RESOURCES [<font color="#008800">file_name="resource.dat"</font>] </b><br>
    	This command loads a time oriented list of resource concentrations.  
        The command takes a file name containing this type of data, and 
        defaults to resource.dat.  The format of the file must be the same 
        as resource.dat, and each line must be in the correct chronological 
        order with oldest first.  
</table>

<h3>Output Formats</h3>

<p>
 Several commands (such as DETAIL and MAP) require format parameters
 to specify what genotypic features should be output.  Before the
 such commands are used, other collection functions may need to be
 run.

<p>
 Allowable formats after a normal load (assuming these values were available
 from the input file to be loaded in) are:
<p>
<center>
<table width=95%>
<tr><td width=33%><b>id</b>           (Genome ID)
    <td width=33%><b>parent_id</b>    (Parent ID)
    <td width=33%><b>num_cpus</b>     (Number of CPUs)
<tr><td><b>total_cpus</b>   (Total CPUs Ever)
    <td><b>length</b>       (Genome Length)
    <td><b>update_born</b>  (Update Born)
<tr><td><b>update_dead</b>  (Update Dead)
    <td><b>depth</b>        (Tree Depth)
    <td><b>sequence</b>     (Genome Sequence)
</table>
</center>

<p>
 After a RECALCULATE, the additional formats become available:

<p>
<center>
<table width=95%>
<tr><td width=33%><b>viable</b> (Is Viable [0/1])
    <td width=33%><b>copy_length</b> (Copied Length)
    <td width=33%><b>exe_length</b> (Executed Length)
<tr><td><b>merit</b> (Merit)
    <td><b>comp_merit</b> (Computational Merit)
    <td><b>gest_time</b> (Gestation Time)
<tr><td><b>efficiency</b> (Replication Efficiency)
    <td><b>fitness</b> (Fitness)
    <td><b>div_type</b> (Divide type used; 1 is default)
<tr><td><b>task.n</b> (# of times task number n is done)
    <td><b>task.n:binary</b> (is task n done, 0/1)
</table>
</center>

<p>
 If a FIND_LINEAGE was done before the RECALCULATE, the parent
 genotype for each regular genotype will be available, enabling the
 additional formats:

<p>
<center>
<table width=95%>
<tr><td width=50%><b>parent_dist</b> (Parent Distance)
    <td width=50%><b>comp_merit_ratio</b>, (Computational Merit Ratio with parent)

 Finally, if an ALIGN is run, one additional format is available:

<h3>Variables</h3>

<p>
 For the moment, all variables can only be a single character (letter or
 number) and begin with a $ whenever they need to be translated to their
 value.  Lowercase letters are global variables, capital letters are
 local to a function (described later), and numbers are arguments to a
 function.  A $$ will act as a single dollar sign, if needed.

<p align=center><b>Table 8: <font color="#008800">Variable-Related Commands</font></b>
<table cellpadding=6>
<tr><td><b>SET [<font color="#0000AA">variable</font>]
	[<font color="#0000AA">value</font>] </b><br>
    	Sets the variable to the value...
<tr><td><b>FOREACH [<font color="#0000AA">variable</font>]
	[<font color="#0000AA">value</font>]
	[<font color="#008800">value ...</font>] </b><br>
    	Set the variable to each of the values listed, and run the code that
        follows between here and the next END command once for each of
	those values.
<tr><td><b>FORRANGE [<font color="#0000AA">variable</font>]
	[<font color="#0000AA">min_value</font>]
	[<font color="#0000AA">max_value</font>]
	[<font color="#008800">step_value=1</font>]</b><br>
    	Set the variable to each of the values between min and max (at steps
	given), and run the code that follows between here and the next END
	command, once for each of those values.
</table>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>
 These functions are currently very primitive with fixed inputs of
 $0 through $9.  $0 is always the function name, and then there can be up
 to 9 other arguments passed through.  Once a function is created, it can
 be run just like any other command.

<p align=center><b>Table 9: <font color="#008800">Function-Related Commands</font></b>
<table cellpadding=6>
<tr><td><b>FUNCTION [<font color="#0000AA">name</font>]</b><br>
    	This will create a function of the given name, including in it all
	of the commands up until an END is found.  These commands will be
	bound to the function, but are not executed until the function is
	run as a command.  Inside the function, the variables $1 through $9
	can be used to access arguments passed in.
</table>

<p>
Currently there are no conditionals or mathematical commands in this
scripting language.  These are both planned for the future.
