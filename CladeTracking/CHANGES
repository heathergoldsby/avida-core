Avida 2.6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Important changes relative to previous Avida 2.x releases:

Binary Executable Names
  The names of the executables generated by build systems have changed.  The
  'primitive' binary is now called 'avida'.  The NCurses viewer is called
  'avida-viewer'.

Configuration File
  Previous versions of avida used a file called 'genesis' to configure primary
  avida settings.  This file has been replaced with 'avida.cfg'.  The format of
  the configuration file has not changed, save for two important exceptions. The
  WORLD-X and WORLD-Y parameters have been changed to WORLD_X and WORLD_Y,
  respectively.   Additionally, several new configuration options are available.

Data output directory
  All output data generated by Avida is now output within a subdirectory.  By
  default this directory is called 'data', however it can be configured via
  the configuration file parameter DATA_DIR.  The directory will created if it
  does not exist at the start of Avida.  Note, however, if supplying a multi-
  level path within DATA_DIR, only the last directory will be created.

Multithreaded Analysis
  Various analysis commands have been enhanced to make use of multiple threads.
  Currently, the number of threads used is configured statically via the
  configuration parameter MT_CONCURRENCY (defaults to 1).  On multiprocessor/
  multicore systems, set this parameter up to the number of physical processors
  available.

  NOTE: Threads are currently unsupported under Win32.

Events and Actions
  Events have been updated and enhanced under a new actions framework.  In this
  process the capitalization and sequence of many events have changed name.  In
  Avida 2.6 many of the previous names (99% of them) have been simply
  deprecated but should still function.  These deprecated namings will be
  removed in future a future release.   For details about the new namings, see
  the included documentation.

Performance
  A number of significant performance enhancements have been implemented within
  this release.  All platforms should enjoy speedier runs and analysis.  In
  addition to algorithmic improvements, a new high performance malloc library
  is used on POSIX (unix/linux/mac) platforms.
