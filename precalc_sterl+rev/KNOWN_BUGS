This file is used to keep track of known "bugs" in avida that are not
important enough to fix, but that we do want to keep track of.

-- Configuration File Related --
* The PARENT_MUT_RATE setting will cause the parent's genome to mutate when
  it gives birth, but currently it is not treated like a second child, so
  the genotype will not be changed, and in general it cannot act with many
  other settings (like mutation reversions)

-- Not bugs, per-se, but ugly coding that should be cleaned up
* BIRTH_METHOD 7 is currently a local birth method, but not grouped with the
  rest of them.  This required a special condition in cBirthChamber.cc for
  local recombination and in cPopulation.cc for offspring facing parent.
