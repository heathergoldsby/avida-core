Avida consistency-checks project : ToDo
</title>
</head>
<body>
<hr>
Figure out where to host cvs repository.
<p>
Test suites for Brian, Charles, Dehua, Eliz, Gabe... Who else ?
<p>
Can't obtain a final organism for Dule's GlobalSex suite.
<p>
The Kazi suite can't be run without using a specially compiled version
of Avida. Need to know hot to build this version.
<p>
Connect to test-results server on toto.
<p>
Integrate with 'current' Avida project (i.e., autodetect presence of
consistency-tests when they're dropped into the 'current' directory).
<p>
Add default cmake variables so that people can just type 'cmake ..'.
