comments: 

Testing the effect of newly implemented local nature of sex, using local,
random replacement as the birth method 

All the parameters in these runs are the same as sex-nature-new-mut 
(p. 150.1) other than the birth method. 

Also added the same treatment with asexuals, and repeated the mass action sex/asex runs.
